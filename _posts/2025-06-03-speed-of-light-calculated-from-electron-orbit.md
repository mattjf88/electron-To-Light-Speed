I’m looking at some numerical relationships and would appreciate insights into any underlying mathematical properties or patterns that might explain the arbitrary operations formulated to near a known constant.

Here's the path i followed:

1.First, I started with known values, Bohr's first electron radius and the velocity of an electron.
Let V and R be specific numerical values,
Let V=2.18 × 10^6 ,
Let R=5.29177 × 10^-11 

2.Next, I calculated a circumfrence-like value (C):
Define C=2 × Pi × R
C=2 × 3.14 × 5.29177 × 10^-11 
Calculating this gives:
C=3.3249 × 10^-10 

3.Then, I found a time-like value (T_1): 
Define T_1=C ÷ V
T_1=3.3249×10^-10  ÷ 2.18×10^6
T_1=1.5251×10^-16 

4.Then, a scaled time value (T_2): 
Define T_2=T_1 ÷ 4
T_2=1.5251×10^-16÷4
T_2=3.8129×10^-17


5.I applied these to the first expression, E_1(t,h):
The expression is defined as:
E_1(t,h)=((2 × t)^2  × (t)^.25  ) ÷ ((h+(h ÷ 15)) × t)
Substitute t = T_2 , h = R
E_1(t,h) = ((2 × 3.8129×10^-17 )^2 × (3.8129×10^-17 )^.25 ) ÷ ((5.29177 × 10^-11 +(5.29177 × 10^-11  ÷ 15)) × 3.8129×10^-17 )
Calculating this gives:
E_1(T_2 , R)=2.123×10^-10

6.Finally, using the second expression  E_2(t,h,N):
E_2(t,h,N) = ((2 × t)^2 × (t)^.25 ) ÷ ((N - (h÷ 15)) × t × 4^3 ) 
Substitute t=1, h=R, N=E_1(T_2 , R)
E_2(1,R,E_1) = ((2 × 1)^2 × (1)^.25 ) ÷ ((2.123×10^-10  - (5.29177 × 10^-11  ÷ 15)) × 1 × 4^3)

Calculating this gives:
E_2(1,R,E_1)=299,369,427

The model to equation, a one dimensional oscillation can start from the center field then move out to the end field which is a change in direction back to the center. The right movement would be (a) , the left movement a fall to the center would be (b) , it is then (a/b) because if (a) was earth (b) would be a asteroid pulling back with its small gravity, there's a mutual change in direction so one is dependent on the other and their a fraction,this started as outgoing. These movements are dependent on the two changes in direction, the center and the end, that make it (a/b)^2, squared because any distance on the first movement is any point for a movement in a dimension to move . That's half the oscillation so double this and it becomes (2a/b)^2. The is another way to move about this model, it's from end to end. Starting from incoming, pulled from end the two halves are equal to each other because there was no change in direction in the center of the oscillation , just momentum, and they are different, ones toward the center as a fall so that is (b) and the other, the puller, once derived from a moving mass is gravity. This could be (b^3) but it's this (2a/Gravityb^2)^2 ,it's inserted into the denominator ,the equation was divided by f a movement that when divided changes direction so it's dependent.  With simplification and (a) and (b) turning into time it turns into (((2 time)^2(time^(¼))/Gravity Time)=height. Equal to height is the integral of gravity.  With simplification it is ((2×time)^2×(time)^.25)÷((height+(height÷15))×time)=Gravity.The height divided by 15  , there are 5 possible movements within a change in direction and 3 changes in direction all together, .4^3 is, the 4 is 2 plus 2, plus because there's gravity and momentum, and 2 because in a two body system there are two points the body's make each other turn direction, when there both at each end and when there each in the center . The 3 is that there is a momentum for every turn and for every movement, their all three per each other
